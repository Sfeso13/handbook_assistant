# **Welcome to 1337**

### **The 1337 Spirit**

Welcome to 1337 Coding School, a school like no other. Here, you won't find teachers, traditional exams, or grades. Instead, you'll find something far more valuable, trust, freedom, and responsibility.

1337 is part of the 42 Network, a global community of schools redefining how the world learns technology. Our mission is simple but powerful: to prepare you to learn, create, and lead through collaboration, resilience, and innovation.

At 1337, you are not just a student, you are an active member of a living, evolving ecosystem.

You own your education, your pace, and your impact. The freedom you have here is matched by one essential rule: you are accountable for it.

### **Our Core Principles**

**Autonomy:** You are in charge of your own learning journey. No one will tell you what to do — but you'll have every tool to figure it out. This freedom is a privilege that demands discipline, consistency, and initiative.

**Community:** The heart of 1337 is its community. You learn from others, and they learn from you. Your success is built on sharing knowledge, supporting your peers, and contributing to the growth of the whole community.

**Excellence Through Effort:** There are no shortcuts here. Progress at 1337 is earned through perseverance, creativity, and problem-solving. You are encouraged to fail, learn, and try again, because mastery comes from experience, not memorization.

**Respect and Integrity:** Freedom without respect destroys trust. Every student, staff member, and visitor deserves to be treated with kindness and professionalism. Integrity is not optional, it's what keeps our community safe, fair, and strong.

**Responsibility:** At 1337, you are responsible for your actions, your space, and your community. That includes your learning, your digital behavior, your campus, and your peers. Your choices shape not only your path but the environment we all share.
### **What 1337 Expects From You**

**Be present**, both physically and mentally. Your participation keeps the community alive.

**Be respectful in all spaces**, physical and digital.

**Be committed to your learning**, your growth, and to helping others grow with you.

**Be accountable for your work**, your behavior, and your use of school resources.

**Be curious and bold**, 1337 rewards creativity and courage, not perfection.

### **A Community Built on Trust**

Everything at 1337, the projects, the evaluations, the systems, runs on one belief:

*"You are capable of leading your own learning."*

That belief only works when you take it seriously.

When you use your freedom responsibly, show up for your peers, and push your limits every day, you help 1337 remain a space of excellence, innovation, and opportunity.

So welcome — to your journey, your challenge, and your community.

Welcome to 1337.

Life at 1337 is built on autonomy, collaboration, and accountability. Here, you take ownership of your learning journey, setting your own pace, managing your time, and finding your own solutions. The school provides the tools, the environment, and the community, but the drive and commitment must come from you.

Independence at 1337 is a privilege that comes with responsibility. Every student is trusted to use that freedom wisely, to learn consistently, to contribute to others' growth, and to stay engaged in the shared energy of the campus.

Being part of 1337 means more than just coding; it means belonging to a community built on respect, creativity, and integrity, where your progress and the collective success of your peers go hand in hand.

## **2. Respect and Behavior**

Respect is one of the most important values at 1337. Our community is built on collaboration and diversity, people from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives working together.

## **3. Hazing & Harassment**

Hazing, bullying, or harassment of any kind is strictly forbidden at 1337. The school maintains a zerotolerance policy toward any act that humiliates, pressures, or threatens another person, whether on campus, in dorms, or online.

- Drugs & illegal substances are strictly forbidden.
- Cigarette waste must be properly disposed of in the bins provided.
- Breaking these rules may lead to disciplinary action.

## **5. Restaurant**

The restaurant is part of your student benefits; it's the school restaurant where meals are offered to students who are actively studying and participating on campus.

**The principle is simple:** *If you are studying at school, the school provides the food, throughout your entire 1337 journey, before and after the Common Core.*

To ensure this benefit is fairly distributed, attendance and activity are tracked**.**

If you fall below the required activity level, your restaurant access may be suspended until you meet your LOGTIME requirements.

### **Behavior in the restaurant:**

- Keep the space clean and organized.
- Return trays and utensils after eating.
- Respect the staff and other students.

## **6. Housing**

Housing is a benefit for actively engaged students and is offered only on campuses with available housing facilities, depending on capacity and compliance with housing regulations. It is monitored through internal systems that track progress, presence, and participation.

The purpose of this system is to make sure housing is used by students who are present, learning, and contributing, not by those who stay isolated in their rooms.

### **Rules:**

- Each student has 18 months of housing credit during the Common Core.
- You must log at least 120 hours of activity per month to keep housing.
- If a student does not meet this requirement, one month will be deducted from the total housing credit, unless the student has checked out of the room.
- Extensions or exceptions must be approved by the BOCAL.

Housing is a privilege that supports your learning and presence at school.

Misuse of housing or failure to meet requirements may lead to loss of benefits.

## **7. Campus Spaces & Facilities**

The 1337 campus is a professional learning environment. Every student shares responsibility for maintaining it.

- Found items are stored for one month. After that, they are discarded.
- Items left in shared spaces are removed.
- If you request to check camera footage, you must specify the exact location and time window of the incident.
- Stealing or attempting to take someone else's belongings will result in disciplinary action.

Keep your valuables safe and be respectful of others' property.

## **9. Storage Room**

The storage room is provided to help students keep their personal belongings safe and the campus organized. To maintain order and hygiene, all items must follow these rules:

- **Only closed bags** are allowed in the storage room.
- Loose items, open bags, or sachets are not permitted.
- Any item not properly stored in a closed bag will be **removed and discarded without exception**.
- Please make sure your belongings are labeled and organized to keep the space clean and accessible for everyone.

1337 encourages collaboration and discussion, but not disruption. Be mindful of others who are working or studying or your neighborhood.

### **Noise rules:**

- Keep conversations at a moderate volume.
- Use headphones for calls, videos, music, or games.

• Avoid loud discussions in all work areas like clusters, meeting rooms, coworking spaces, labs or outside the school especially by night (9pm to 8am).

*Student HandBook*

### **Important Note:**

The school is located near a residential & professional areas. Out of respect for our neighbors and the community, you must keep noise levels low outside the school, especially between 9:00 PM & 8:00 AM. Loud conversations, gatherings, or music during these hours are strictly prohibited.

## **11. Presence & Engagement**

Your presence is what keeps 1337 alive. This is not a remote learning environment; the school thrives on in-person collaboration and shared energy.

Being present means more than just showing up, it means participating, sharing ideas, and helping others grow.

## **12. Access & visits**

### **a. Access to the School**

### **Sanctions can include:**

- Warnings or formal notices.
- Temporary suspension of privileges (Restaurant, Scholarship, housing, etc.).
- Restriction of access to systems or facilities.

## **11. Remember: You Shape the Culture**

At 1337, culture is not imposed, it's created by the people in it.

Your words, actions, and choices define what kind of community this will be.

Every student has the power to make 1337 a place where people feel safe to learn, fail, and try again.

Be the kind of peer others want to collaborate with, respectful, honest, curious, and driven.

The school will give you opportunities, freedom, and trust.

It's up to you to live up to them.
*This community*  **"** *is a mirror: the more you give to it, the stronger it becomes.*

# **Academic Life & Pedagogy**

## **1. Learning at 1337**

Learning at 1337 is unlike any other experience. There are no teachers, no lectures, and no fixed curriculum. You are the main actor in your learning journey.

You learn by doing, by failing, by trying again, and by sharing what you've discovered with others.

The school gives you the structure, the tools, and the community.

You bring the motivation, the curiosity, and the discipline.

This model works only if you stay engaged, proactive, and honest with yourself and others.

## **2. The Peer-to-Peer Model**

The principles are simple:

- **1. You learn by doing.** Every project challenges you to apply and explore new concepts.
- **2. You learn by sharing.** Teaching others helps you understand more deeply.
- **3. You learn by collaborating.** Working with others builds creativity and resilience.

Peer evaluation is not just part of the system; it is the system. It trains you to give feedback, defend your choices, and communicate like a professional.

## **3. Projects & Evaluations**

Projects are at the core of 1337's learning experience. Each project builds both technical and behavioral skills, helping you grow step by step.

### **a. Solo Projects:**

You are fully responsible for the work. You must understand every part of your code and be able to explain it.

### **b. Group Projects:**

You are responsible for your part and must understand the project's overall logic and goals. Collaboration, clear communication, and fair task distribution are key to success.

### **c. Evaluation Process:**

- Projects are evaluated through peer correction.
- Each student acts as both corrector and corrected.
- The process helps you practice critical thinking and technical analysis.
- No third party may interfere in a correction, only the corrector and the corrected participate.

If a project doesn't pass, it's not failure, it's feedback. Every attempt is an opportunity to learn and improve.

### **d. Correction Attendance and Conduct**

Corrections are an essential learning and community exercise based on respect and fairness.

### **Rules:**

- You must attend scheduled corrections on time.
- If you need to cancel or reschedule, notify the corrector in advance.
- If the corrector does not respond within 30 minutes, the correction can be cancelled and rescheduled.
- Correctors must follow the official correction sheet and stay within the project's core concepts. They may test or question any aspect related to the project, but not beyond the defined project scope. Corrections are meant for learning not for intimidation or revenge.

• If a correction becomes disrespectful or unfair, report it to the BOCAL. It can be repeated in the presence of staff if needed.

### **Sanctions:**

- Missing or cancelling a correction without valid reason: 2-day suspension.
- Cancelling projects more than three times: 1-week suspension and temporary loss of benefits.
- Validating a cheated project during correction: 15-day suspension, in addition to possible further sanctions.

**The correction process is strictly between the corrector and the corrected, no third party may intervene or be present during the evaluation.**

## **4. Recoding**

At 1337, the goal is not only to finish projects but to master what you build. **Every student should expect to be recoded for at least one project during the Common Core**, this is a normal part of the learning process designed to verify understanding and mastery. Recoding is not a punishment. It is a competency check used to confirm that each student can reproduce and explain their work independently.

### **In addition to the systematic recoding, it may also apply in the following cases:**

- Your code is identical or very similar to another student's.
- There are irregularities, such as:
  - o Unusual last-minute pushes.
  - o Suspiciously fast project completion.
  - o Repeated identical submissions.
  - o Reports or alerts from peers.
- A student repeatedly fails to pass a circle exam after multiple attempts (three attempts).

### **What recoding involves:**

- Rewriting the project, or a part of it, under observation.
- Explaining your code and logic step-by-step to a staff member.
- Demonstrating full understanding of the project's goals, functions, and structure.

Recoding proves your work is truly yours and ensures fairness and credibility for everyone.

## **5. Sanctions Related to Cheating**

1337 operates on trust, your progress, evaluations, and collaboration are all based on honesty. Any form of cheating, plagiarism, or dishonesty breaks that trust and harms the integrity of the community.

### **Cheating means more than copying code. It includes:**

- Pushing a project you don't fully understand or can't reproduce.
- Sharing or duplicating code between students.
- Submitting identical or suspiciously similar projects.
- Manipulating or falsifying corrections.
- Engaging in unfair behavior during peer corrections or projects.

Cheating can be detected through identical code submissions, unusual push activity, reports, or inability to explain one's work during recoding.

### **Sanctions for cheating:**

- **First Attempt:** One-month suspension and a mandatory systematic recoding immediately afterward.
- **Second Attempt:** Permanent exclusion from the school.
- **A second chance** after the first offense is not guaranteed and will be granted only in exceptional cases.
- **If two students have identical solo projects:**  Both receive 15 days suspension and a mandatory systematic recoding immediately afterward.

### **Important:**

Cheating during a correction, validating a cheated project, or ignoring correction rules can also result in sanctions.

### **Remember:**

These rules exist not to punish but to protect fairness and the value of your hard work.

*You are here to learn, not to fake success.*

## **6. Benefits and Engagement Policy**

1337 provides social benefits (housing, meals, insurance, and scholarship) to help every student focus fully on learning and growing. These supports exist so that you can dedicate your time and energy to developing your skills and preparing for your future, without external barriers.

But with this support comes responsibility. These benefits are meant to help you progress, not to be taken for granted or used without genuine engagement. Misusing them, staying inactive, or trying to take advantage of the system goes against the values of 1337 and the trust it places in you.

At 1337, each benefit is connected to the school's systems — the **Heart System**, the **Supervisor**, and **LOGTIME tracking**, to make sure that everyone uses these resources fairly and responsibly.

### **Important Note:**

Students who are full time employees are not eligible for social benefits provided by 1337, including housing, meals, insurance, or scholarships.

## **7. The Heart System**

### **(Common Core Progress Tracking)**

The **Common Core** can be completed in a **maximum of two years** (24 months). However, the **average duration** expected for progression is **18 months**, also known as **Pace 18**.

During these **18 months**, the school provides full **student benefits** (scholarship, housing, meals, etc.) to support your learning journey.

To help you **stay on track** and **maintain your benefits**, the **Heart System** has been introduced. Each student starts the Common Core with **three hearts**, representing their capacity to progress within Pace 18.

### **Rules**:

- Each time you fall behind Pace 18, you lose one heart.
- Hearts cannot be regained once lost.
- After losing a heart, you have **up to three months** to recover your progress and return to Pace 18.
- **You have a total credit of 18 months** to complete the Common Core; this includes any catch-up period.

If you lose all 3 hearts, **you lose all your social benefits**, **only your access to the school remains**. You can still continue your education, but without housing, meals, or other benefits. This system helps you manage your time, stay consistent, and take ownership of your learning path.

**Note:** *The Heart System applies to students starting*  from the 2025 cohort.

## **8. The Supervisor System**

### **(After the Common Core)**

After completing the common core, each student enters the **Slot system**, which regulates progression and access to school benefits.

- Each **Slot** has a duration of **four (4) months**.
- During this period, the student must complete specific **pre-requisites**, which include:
- o A defined **XP target** to achieve;
- o A required number of **peer corrections** to perform;
- o A minimum **logtime** per month;
- o And overall engagement in the learning process.
- At the end of each Slot, an **assessment meeting**  is conducted with the staff to review the student's performance and identify any difficulties or reasons for non-achievement.

If the student has not met all required objectives:

- They are **granted a new Slot** (4 additional months),
- **All benefits are maintained**,
- But the student is required to **recover all pending credits** from the previous Slot.

After two consecutive Slots without meeting the required achievements,

- o **All school benefits are suspended**,
- o Only **school access** remains active until progression is regained.

## **9. Freezes**

### **(Temporary Pauses)**

A freeze is a temporary pause in your academic progress. It exists to support students who need to step back from their studies for an **exceptional valid personal, health, or family reasons**, not to postpone work or extend benefits unnecessarily.

### **Rules:**

- All freeze requests must be submitted in advance to the BOCAL.
- Freezes for personal, health, or family reasons require validation from **both the BOCAL** and **the 1337 Doctor (Dr. Hanane RASFI)**.
- Exceptionally, students may request a freeze during holidays; limited to one (1) week during Eids and two (2) weeks during summer but with prior approval from the BOCAL.
- Unplanned absences or inactive periods without approval will not be considered as freezes.
- Extended or repeated freezes may affect your benefits and overall academic timeline, including housing and Restaurant eligibility.

Freezes are here to help, not to reset or delay your learning. Use them only when necessary and always communicate with the BOCAL.

## **10. Internship Policy**

Internships are an essential part of your journey at 1337. They allow you to apply what you've learned in real-world environments, gain hands-on experience, and connect with professionals in the tech and innovation ecosystem. Each one must align with your academic goals and the values of 1337.

- They may be accepted if they take place within the **OCP/UM6P ecosystem** or in **exceptional** external companies that meet 1337's learning standards.

The goal is not to restrict opportunities but to ensure every internship contributes to your personal and technical growth.

## **11. LOGTIME**

Your access to benefits like housing, restaurant, scholarships, depends on your LOGTIME. These systems are tracked internally to ensure fairness and engagement.

### **LOGTIME targets:**

- **Restaurant access:** 30h/week.
- **Housing:** 120h/month.
- Blackhole and Freeze rules apply as defined in school policy.

### **Sanctions for LOGTIME Cheating:**

- Scholarships may be suspended for disciplinary reasons (e.g., behavior or misconduct…).

## **13. Transportation**

Transportation is one of the social benefits provided by 1337 to make student life easier. Depending on your campus, transportation may include day and/ or night shuttles organized to help you travel safely between the school and designated areas.

Each campus has its own transportation schedule, routes, and rules, these are communicated locally by the BOCAL.

### **Usage Rules**

- Transportation is a benefit, not a right, it is reserved for active students only.
- Students under the following statuses cannot use the transportation service: Blackhole, Suspension, or Alumni (except with specific prior approval)

- Students must respect the schedules, drivers, and other passengers.
- Any misuse, damage, or inappropriate behavior during transportation may **lead to disciplinary action or loss of access to the service**.

Transportation is provided to help you focus on your studies and stay engaged with campus life, use it responsibly and respectfully.

## **14. Insurance Coverage**

Every 1337 student is automatically covered by the school's insurance from the first day of integration. This coverage is here to keep you safe and supported while you learn.

### **a. Types of Coverage**

- **1. Civil Liability (RC):** Protects you if you unintentionally cause harm or damage to another person or their property. It's a guarantee that ensures you are protected in case of an unintentional incident involving a third party.
- **2. Assistance:** a 24/7 on-campus assistance (services, not direct cash reimbursement) in case of an emergency or unexpected situation due to accident or illness within the campus.
- **3. Health & Life (Illness / Accident ....):** Covers illness or accident, including medical care, hospitalization, and related expenses… according to the insurer's terms.

In severe cases, it provides benefits as defined in the policy. (**Coverage limits, eligible expenses, and procedures are to check with the Health Center.**)

### **b. Duration of Coverage**

- **All three contracts** (RC, Assistance, Health/Life) are active from your **first day at 1337**.
- **Health & Life** remains valid for a maximum of two years after the Common Core (18 months + internship, managed by the Heart System), then it is automatically terminated, it's **managed via Supervisor**.
- RC and Assistance remain active as long as you are officially enrolled (full-time or part-time, regardless of Supervisor).

### **c. Important Notes**

- If you already have another personal or institutional insurance (other than the school one), **you must inform the BOCAL** on your first day at 1337 or on the day you declare your external insurance.
- **For any incident**, follow the reporting steps and timelines provided by the BOCAL/insurer to ensure coverage applies.

## **15. Attendo System**

Attendo is the system that links your presence on campus with your restaurant access. It's a fairness system designed to make sure the restaurant benefits only students who are actively studying and contributing to campus life.

### **How It Works**

- Every time you eat at the restaurant, that day is added to your personal **Attendo chain**.
- Once you've eaten on 7 different days, that forms one **Attendo week**.
- Attendo checks your total **logtime** for those 7 days.

### **To stay eligible for the restaurant:**

- You must log **at least 30 hours** of presence during those 7 restaurant days.
- If you meet this goal, your restaurant **badge stays active**.
- If you fall below 30 hours, **your access freezes automatically** until you catch up.
- Once you recover your missing hours, your access reactivates automatically, no staff intervention needed.

### **Key Rules**

- **Attendo is individual,** never share your badge or let someone else use it.
- Your **Attendo week** is based only on real restaurant days, not calendar weeks.
- **Inactive days or official freeze periods** do not count toward your 7 days.
- You can check your live status anytime on Attendo:
- **o Green =** active access
- **o Red =** frozen access

### **Why It Exists**

Attendo keeps the system fair by ensuring that:

- Restaurant access equals real school activity.
- Students who are consistently engaged are the ones benefiting.
- Badge sharing or unfair use of benefits is prevented.

Attendo is here to promote fairness, responsibility, and community trust — so that every student who truly contributes gets the support they deserve.
